## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

To design and create the basic layout, userflow, function, navagation and design of a website.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Low-fidelity wireframes
This is similar to a rough draft as it's a very basic concept.

Mid-fidelity wireframes
This is the most popular and is a more accurate layout of what it's going to look like, but lacks actual pictures, fonts, texts, etc.

High-fidelity wireframes
This will be a similar replica to the final product. It uses actual images, fonts, texts, etc. that will be used on the final product. 

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Yes, especially using a tool like like Figma because you can style it the way you want without having to code, then you can copy the code it provides.
