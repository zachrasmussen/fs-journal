## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use.

You can apply a pseudo-class to a selector when you want it to act a certain way. for example:

button:hover

This will make it so when you hover over a button it will perform the way it's designed to.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is built into CSS and determines which rule should be applied. The more specific the rule is, means the rule will be chosen to run over a less specific rule.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

If you have too many !important it could throw off the specificity and make it confused.
