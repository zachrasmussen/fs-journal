## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

In the professional world it's common for several different developers to work on a project together. Depending on the size of the project, there might be several teams working closely on different parts. Because of this, there needs to be a way to control the code so there aren't any conflicts. 

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Similar to the previous answer, with multiple developers working on a project, you may have different parts of the project in different phases. You wouldn't want to put code that is in a development stage into the code that is live. So, you can create multiple branches to accomodate the various phases of a project.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git is for version control while GitHub is a way to control your repositories on the cloud.
