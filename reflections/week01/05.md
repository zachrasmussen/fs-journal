# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This has been a good week. I particularly liked when you add class='debug' to the body using bootstrap it gives you the lines on the screen. This just helped me visualize everything better.

I also enjoyed the morning challenges and those seemed to help me quite a bit.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I think making "friends" helped with my confidence, which spilled over to learning.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?


- What are you struggling with?

display-flex and I get mixed up when to use justify-content, align-items, etc.

- What would you count as a victory?

Overall I'd consider the entire week a victory. I came in very nervous, but now I'm feeling more confident.
