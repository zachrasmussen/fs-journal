## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

console.log(to make sure that what we write in JavaScript works.) If it doesn't work, it won't be logged. It's better to write lots of console.log() to make sure your code is working, then get to the end and it doesn't run and you have to go through everything to figure out where you went wrong.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The elements tab. Here you can change and apply things to the elements and instantly see how it changes it. For example, instead of trying to get the drop shadow just right in CSS and trying it over and over again, you can change it and see the results and once you find what you like you can change it to your CSS.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

You can add a debugger to your app.js file and when you run your code you can see how it works step by step.
