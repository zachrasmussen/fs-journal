# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

One thing that really helped this week was that we covered similar concepts all week building on it each day. If we would have learned something completely new every day I think I would have gotten lost.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

One thing that came as a surprise was that learning about dictionaries and how to use them.

- What are you struggling with?

I'm still struggling with what functions I all need to create.

- What would you count as a victory?

I still don't feel 100% confident, but the fact that my confidence improved each day and as I refrence the lecture notes I can recognize why we do certain things.
