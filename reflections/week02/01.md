## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Globally scoped is when var is used outside the function. Function scoped is when var is used inside the function. The variable of function scope can only function inside the function, while global scope can function anywhere. Block scope is used by let and const and is used inside of the curly braces.

2. What is Hoisting ?

Before code is executed, variables and function declarations are moved to the top of the scope.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

let is used when a variable is planned on being changed.
const is used for variables where the variable will always be the same (i.e. days of the week or months of the year).
var can be used in place of let or const.
