## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

It allows you to research and think about what you're trying to do, then create code that makes sense and flows well. If you don't have a plan then you might have to change things along the way which might take up time.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

Don't rush to the first answer you come across. Sometimes you want to figure it out yourself, but the best solution might be researching it, even if that means looking on Google.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

Just because something is working, doesn't necessarily mean that it is right or correct. There might be ways to improve it, simplify it or make it better.
