## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Each task, both large and small gets a certain amount of time to be completed in.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

Working for 50-55 minutes then taking a 5-10 minute break.
Timebox an amount of time that I'll give myself to resolve a problem before I go ask for help.
Putting my schedule on a calendar so I can get reminders and visually see what I'm supposed to be doing and when.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

When I first started codeworks, I'd spend a lot of time trying to resolve my own issue before asking for time, which resulted in a lot of wasted time.
