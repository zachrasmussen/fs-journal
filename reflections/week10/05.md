# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I had three job interviews and lined two more up for next week. Two of the interviews went really well.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

C#, not a big fan. MySQL is pretty cool though.

- What are you struggling with?

Postman. I think I'm setting it up incorrectly and can't get any of my tests to run properly.

- What would you count as a victory?

Made it through another week. Holy Crap, week 11 starts on monday!
