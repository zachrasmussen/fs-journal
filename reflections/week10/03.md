## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

a row contains all the information for an item, while a column is about a certain category.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE characters(
    id INT
    name STRING,
    age STING,
    description STRING
);

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
delete is deleting an item from the table. drop is deleting everything, including the table itself.
