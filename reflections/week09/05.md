# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

Working with my team this week. We communicated well, improved our planning efforts and overcame opsticals. 

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

Working with a team is hard. People write code differently and having to work on files others are working on takes some getting used to.

- What are you struggling with?

Confidence within the backend.

- What would you count as a victory?

Surviving another week and making it through capstone.
