# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.



## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I overcame a huge mental block this week. I was on a super low tuesday and wednesday morning and the material we were learning started to click and snapped me out of my funk.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

How complex yet how simple MVC is.

- What are you struggling with?

What is necessary to be on each page of MVC - i.e. exports, imports, etc.

- What would you count as a victory?

Just continuing to progress forward.
