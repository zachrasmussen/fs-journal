## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

The morning of my first day I was feeling anxious. Brittany sent me a message on LinkedIn wishing me the best and told me to trust the process. That's what I've done throughout the course. I feel I've put in the work but I'm feeling nervous about the final. I love the front end and enjoyed everything that pertains to that.
