# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

This week we had the week to work on the checkpoint. Since we worked on the same project every day, I felt like I was able to ask a lot of questions based around the project, which ultimately helped me grow. I feel like I grew the most this week because of doing one project throughout the week and being able to ask questions along the way.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

Full stack is hard, but at the same time it's easier than you'd expect. Sounds confusing, right?

- What are you struggling with?

Api - this week it started to make a little bit more sense, but I'm still confused.

- What would you count as a victory?

Surviving another week and making it to week 8.
