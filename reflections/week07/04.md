## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

I always try to take into consideration the UX of a project. What would make the experience the most enjoyable for the user.

2. What went well this week?

This week we had the week to work on the checkpoint. Since we worked on the same project every day, I felt like I was able to ask a lot of questions based around the project, which ultimately helped me grow.

3. What would you do differently?

Time box better.
