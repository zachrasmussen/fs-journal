# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I worked on my goal for the week, which was to ask more questions in lab for better understanding and that seemed to help.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

APIs are more confusing and complicated than I thought

- What are you struggling with?

Last week we covered MVC and I feel like it started to make sense toward the end of the week. This week we built on top of it by adding API, async and await. Even though we didn't add much, I don't feel 100% on those things.

- What would you count as a victory?

Making it through another week.
